## School Shooting Analysis
This repository contains an independent project focused on analyzing Shooting Incidents at K-12 Schools (Jan 1970-Jun 2022) provided by the Center for Homeland Defense and Security. The goal of this project is to create models from the data to help us understand the effects gun and mental health predictors on victimhood outcomes. In doing so, we might be able to provide recommendations on interventions for characteristics that are associated with high-likelihood cases of victimhood.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used in this project is the Shooting Incidents at K-12 Schools dataset, which is publicly available from the Center for Homeland Defense and Security. The dataset contains information on over 1,000 shooting incidents that have occurred at K-12 schools in the United States since 1970.

### File Structure
The repository is organized into several directories, each with its own purpose:

`code/`: contains the code files used to clean and explore the data, including `01_tidy.R`, `02_EDA.R`, `functions.R`, and a `README.md` file.

`data/`: contains the raw data file (`SSDB_Raw_Data_2022.csv`) and a `README.md` file.

`docs/`: contains the R Markdown report (`school-shooting-analysis.Rmd`) and a `README.md` file.

`output/`: contains any output files generated by the analysis and a `README.md` file.

`README.md`: this file.
